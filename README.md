# Aerial Fire Detection using Computer Vision and Drone

The Dataset for this Project is obtained from:
Alireza Shamsoshoara, Fatemeh Afghah, Abolfazl Razi, Liming Zheng, Peter Ful√©, Erik Blasch, November 19, 2020, "The FLAME dataset: Aerial Imagery Pile burn detection using drones (UAVs)", IEEE Dataport, doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/qad6-r683.

1. Use ```drone_fire_detection_yolov8.ipynb``` to train the model
2. ```Supervision_Image_Inferencing.ipynb``` to run inference on images
3. ```Supervision_Video_Inferencing.ipynb``` to run inference on video
